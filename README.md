# TIC-TAC_TOE-project-for-Micro-IT
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players in the console. Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid until one wins or the game ends in a draw. Great for practicing loops, conditionals, and 2D arrays. Ideal for beginners learning game logic and turn-based interaction.
